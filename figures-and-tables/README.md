Final figures and tables published alongside the manuscript.

## Figures

- [Figure 1](): Timeline of experimental treatments and sampling. After collection and cleaning of plants to remove grazers, epiphytes and diseased tissue, eelgrass ramets were held at 14⁰C for 1d and then transferred in groups of 4 ramets to 11⁰C or 18⁰C for a 10d acclimation period. Each group of 4 ramets was replicated 8 times during the acclimation period. After that, the groups were equally divided into control and *Lz*–exposed treatments at each of the two temperatures. *Lz* or sham exposures occurred for 36 hr. Subsampling of plants occurred at days 2 and 5 post-*Lz* exposure.
- [Figure 2](): *Lz* cell equivalents (per mg eelgrass tissue) from qPCR analysis of eelgrass leaf tissue 2 days post-inoculation. Bars indicate standard errors.
- [Figure 3](): Prevalence of observed disease signs on eelgrass blades 2 and 5 days post-inoculation. Error bars indicate ± 1 standard error of the replicate mean.
- [Figure 4](): Effects of temperature and *Lz* treatment on condensed tannins and total phenolic compounds (as a percentage of eelgrass dry mass) 2 and 5 days post-inoculation. Data are means (+ 1 SE).
- [Figure 5](https://github.com/eimd-2019/project-EWD-transcriptomics/blob/master/figures-and-tables/figure-5.pdf): Results of *Z. marina* WCGNA analysis. a) Cluster dendrogram of 3,096 genes used in WGCNA analysis. Modules were identified (Dynamic Tree Cut), then merged based on a cut height of 0.34 (Merged dynamic). All modules contain at least 30 genes. b) Significant correlations between module eigengenes (rows) and *Lz* infection status (column). The R<sup>2</sup> value is provided for each significant correlation, with P-value in parentheses. Positive correlations are represented by red boxes, while negative correlations are represented by blue boxes, with the intensity of the color increasing with correlation strength. c) Expression of module eigengenes significantly correlated *Lz* exposure for exposed and control eelgrass.

## Tables

- [Table 1](https://github.com/eimd-2019/project-EWD-transcriptomics/blob/master/figures-and-tables/table-1.csv): Biological process and molecular function GOterms enriched within significant module eigengenes for *Z. marina*.
