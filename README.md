## Abstract

Seagrass meadows serve as an integral component of coastal ecosystems but are declining rapidly due to numerous anthropogenic stressors including climate change. Eelgrass wasting disease, caused by opportunistic *Labyrinthula* spp., is an increasing concern with rising seawater temperature. To better understand the host-pathogen interaction, we paired whole organism physiological assays with dual transcriptomic analysis of the infected host and parasite. Eelgrass (*Zostera marina*) shoots were placed in one of two temperature treatments, 11° C or 18° C, acclimated for 10 days, and exposed to a waterborne inoculation containing infectious *Labyrinthula zosterae* (*Lz*) or sterile seawater. At two- and five-days post-exposure, pathogen load, visible disease signs, whole leaf phenolic content, and both host- and pathogen- transcriptomes were characterized. Two days after exposure, more than 90% of plants had visible lesions and *Lz* DNA was detectable in 100% percent of sampled plants in the *Lz* exposed treatment. Concentrations of total phenolic compounds were lower after 5 days of combined exposure to warmer temperatures and *Lz*, but were unaffected in other treatments. Concentrations of condensed tannins were not affected by *Lz* or temperature, and did not change over time. Analysis of the eelgrass transcriptome revealed 540 differentially expressed genes in response to *Lz* exposure, but not temperature. *Lz*-exposed plants had gene expression patterns consistent with increased defense responses through altered regulation of phytohormone biosynthesis, stress response, and immune function pathways. Analysis of the pathogen transcriptome revealed up-regulation of genes potentially involved in breakdown of host defense, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and metabolism. The lack of a significant temperature signal was unexpected, but suggests a more pronounced physiological response to *Lz* infection as compared to temperature. Pre-acclimation of eelgrass plants to the temperature treatments may have contributed to the limited physiological responses to temperature.  Collectively, these data characterize a widespread physiological response to pathogen attack and demonstrate the value of paired transcriptomics to understand infections in a host-pathogen system.
